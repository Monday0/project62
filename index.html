        <p>My favroite hobby is ART. I like art because it is really fun. You get creative and your imagination grows. Most people think that art is just painting or drawing but it can be anything. It can be pottory, sculpting, painting, baking cakes... Anything! This is why I like art as my hobby.</p>
